## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Intent Validator QA** tool automates the quality assurance process for integration intent mapping. It scans your Google Sheet for trigger phrases, compares them against a central rules engine (`intent_rules.json` stored in Drive), and flags any mismatches between the **Current Action** and the **Predicted Action**.

This tool is designed for speed and scalability, using **Batch Processing** to handle thousands of rows in seconds without hitting Google's execution limits. ⚡💨

## ✨ Key Features

*   **⚡ Batch Optimization**: Reads entire sheets in a single API call, processing data in-memory for blazing-fast performance.
*   **🧠 Auto-Fix Engine**: Correct intent mismatches directly from the sidebar with a single click! 🛠️✅
*   **🎨 Joyful UI**: A vibrant, interactive sidebar interface built with the "Joyful UI Protocol" (Poppins fonts, gradients, and micro-interactions).
*   **📊 Auto-Dashboard**: Automatically generates a "QA – Dashboard" sheet with summary statistics and visual bar charts of mismatch rates.
*   **🔍 Regex Rules**: Uses regex-enabled pattern matching for precise intent classification (e.g., `^Create.*`).
*   **🛡️ Legacy Protection**: Automatically skips sheets marked with `(Legacy)` to preserve historical data.
*   **🔧 Trigger Matrix Normalizer**: Includes a normalization utility (`TriggerMatrixNormalizer.gs`) to split bundled triggers and map behaviors semantically.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system is powered by a `intent_rules.json` file stored in Google Drive. This file dictates the logic for classifying triggers.

**File Structure (`intent_rules.json`):**
```json
{
  "actions_order": ["Create Record", "Update Record", "Search/Query"],
  "rules": {
    "Create Record": ["new", "add", "create", "insert"],
    "Update Record": ["change", "update", "modify", "edit"],
    "Search/Query": ["find", "search", "get", "lookup"]
  }
}
```
